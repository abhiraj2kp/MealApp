setup
1. install redux
2. need a lib. that helps us to connect redux to react native i.e react redux.
3. Redux is the best way to managing state in application. it store the state of application
    into one perticular place. that perticular place is known as store.
4. So how can we modify the state ?. the state can be modified by action. however action does't 
    modified the state directly. the action must go through to the Reducer to modified the store
5. the reducer is nothing just a function. that recieves an action, modified a state to give us a
    new state . (Note the state is read only).
5. However action goest to reducer? by something called Dispatcher. i.e action is send by someone to reducer.
    someone can be a onpress. (on onPress i.e we dispact an action which will goes to the reducer) 
6. store needs a reducer which will access it and modified it.  
7. Connecting a store to our RN App known as Provider.            
/**
 * Store - holds our state - THERE IS ONLY ONE STATE 
 * Action - State can be modified using actions - SIMPLE OBJECTS 
 * Dispatcher - Action needs to be sent by someone - known as dispatching an action
 * Reducer - receives the action and modifies the state to give us a new state 
 *  - pure functions 
 *  - only mandatory argument is the 'type' 
 * Subscriber - listens for state change to update the ui
